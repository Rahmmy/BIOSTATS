## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Poisson distribution
How often can 3 mutations could occur under a Poisson model with a rate parameter of 5

Using X as the event (3) and lambda as the rate parameter (5)

dpois(x = 3, lambda = 5) 

What are the indiviadual probabilities of 0 to 12 mutations with a rate parameter of 5. Visalualize these probabilities with a barplot

dpois(x = 0:12, lambda = 5)
barplot(dpois(0:12, 5), names.arg = 0:12, col = "green",xlab = "Number of mutations", ylab = "Probability")

Finding the frequencies of categories in a data (e.g bloodgroup)
bloodgroup = c("AA","AO","BB","AO","OO","AO","AA","BO","BO",
             "AO","BB","AO","BO","AB","OO","AB","BB","AO","AO")
table(bloodgroup)

Creating a factor that can be used by the level function in identifying discrete categories

bloodgroupF = factor(bloodgroup)
levels(bloodgroupF)

#Bernoulli trials
#Trail with equal probabilities
The outcome of 15 Bernoulli trials with a probability of success equal to 0.5
rbinom(15, prob = 0.5, size = 1)
each trail is independent of the other hence the difference in the answers when run

#Trail with unequal probabilities
rbinom(12, prob = 2/3, size = 1)

#Binomial random variable
set.seed(235569515)
rbinom(1, prob = 0.3, size = 15)

#Probability mass distribution displayed in 2 decimal places
probabilities = dbinom(0:15, prob = 0.3, size = 15)
round(probabilities, 2)
#Bar plot ofthe probabilities
barplot(probabilities, names.arg = 0:15, col = "green", xlab="Number of trials", ylab = "Probability")


#Trail question
#What is the output of the formula for k=3, p=2/3,n=4?

dbinom(3, size = 4, prob = 2/3)
x = factorial(4)/factorial(1)/ factorial(3)* (2/3)^3*(1/3)
